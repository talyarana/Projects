# 📈 Glass Container Production Forecasting  
> Time Series Analysis & Predictive Modelling

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyses historical **glass container production data** to identify trends, seasonality, and optimal forecasting models.  
Using **time series decomposition, regression, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and ARIMA**, the study builds statistically validated models to generate **18-month production forecasts** for business planning.

The final **hybrid ETS-or-ARIMA strategy** delivers the most accurate forecasts, outperforming standard benchmarks such as **Naive, Seasonal Naive, and Mean models**.

## 🔎 Problem Statement

Manufacturing companies require accurate production forecasts to support:

- Inventory planning  
- Capacity management  
- Supply chain optimisation  

However, production data contains **trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation**, making simple forecasting unreliable.  
This project addresses how statistical time-series models can be used to produce **reliable and interpretable forecasts**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify trends and seasonality in production data  
- Test normality, independence, and model assumptions  
- Build and compare **Regression, ETS, and ARIMA models**  
- Select the best-performing forecasting strategy  
- Produce accurate **18-month production forecasts**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Monthly glass container production data  
- Period: **1981 – 1991**  
- Strong seasonal and trend components  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

The analysis followed a structured forecasting pipeline:

1. Exploratory time-series visualisation  
2. Decomposition into **trend, seasonality, and random components**  
3. Statistical testing (Shapiro-Wilk, Durbin-Watson, Breusch-Pagan)  
4. Linear regression with seasonal dummies  
5. ETS model selection  
6. ARIMA model selection using **AICc**  
7. Forecast evaluation using **MAPE, MAE, RMSE**

## 📊 Key Analyses & Outcomes

### 1️⃣ Production Time Series

The raw time series shows **clear seasonality and long-term variation**, confirming the need for seasonal forecasting models.

---

### 2️⃣ Seasonal Decomposition

Additive decomposition separates the data into:

- **Trend** – long-term movement  
- **Seasonal** – recurring yearly patterns  
- **Random** – short-term noise

This confirms strong seasonality and structural variation in production.

---

### 3️⃣ ARIMA Forecast

After testing multiple configurations using **AICc**, the best model selected was:

**ARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12]**

This model captures both **seasonal and short-term dependencies**.

---

### 4️⃣ ETS vs ARIMA Forecast Comparison

The **hybrid strategy** dynamically selects the better model between ETS and ARIMA based on validation error.

This approach produced the **lowest forecasting error** across all test series.
